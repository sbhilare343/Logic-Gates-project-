# Logic-Gates-project-

The provided code is a C programme that works as a logic gate calculator. The user can use it to operate logically on the two variables A and B. This calculator supports the following logic gates: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR.

The input values for A and B are initially defined as two four-element integer arrays, which represent all conceivable combinations of 0s and 1s for two variables. The user is then given a menu of various operations by the application and asked to select one.

As a logic gate calculator, the offered code is a C application. It can be used by the user to perform logical operations on the two variables A and B. The following logic gates are supported by this calculator: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR.

Two four-element integer arrays are used as the starting definition of the input values for A and B, representing all potential combinations of 0s and 1s for two variables. The application then asks the user to choose from a menu of available operations.
